# Robot_pet Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This project is an entry for the National College Students Embedded Competition Chip Application Track ‚Äî **PawAI Companion: Interactive Smart Pet Companion System**.

This system is a complete intelligent pet interaction platform that enables natural interaction between humans and desktop electronic pets through face recognition, gesture recognition, cloud communication, and other technologies. The system supports multi-user management, features an affection cultivation mechanism, and provides cloud synchronization functionality, allowing users to monitor and control pet status in real-time through mobile apps.

## Core Values

- **Personalized Interaction**: Identifies different users through face recognition technology and maintains independent affection profiles for each user
- **Intelligent Response**: Enables natural human-computer interaction through gesture recognition, allowing pets to understand and respond to user actions
- **Cloud Synchronization**: Supports remote monitoring and control, users can stay informed about pet status anytime through Tuya Smart App
- **Cultivation Experience**: Provides continuous interaction motivation through the affection system, enhancing user engagement
- **High Extensibility**: Modular design supports feature expansion, such as voice interaction, additional sensor integration, etc.

## Main Features

### üéØ User Identification and Management
- **Face Detection and Recognition**: Extracts facial feature vectors through face detection-alignment-recognition pipeline
- **Multi-user Support**: Automatically identifies different users and maintains independent affection data for each user
- **Data Persistence**: Stores user information and affection history based on SQLite database

### ü§ñ Intelligent Interaction Control
- **Gesture Recognition**: Subscribes to `/hobot_hand_gesture_detection` topic for real-time user gesture recognition
- **Action Mapping**: Maps recognized gestures to specific robot control commands
- **Serial Communication**: Sends control commands to the lower computer via serial port to achieve robot action control
- **Real-time Feedback**: Receives responses from lower computer to ensure successful command execution

### üìä Affection Cultivation System
- **UI Interface**: Displays pet affection, pet status, daily check-in and task completion
- **Automatic Growth**: Each successful interaction increases affection
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Affection changes are saved to local database in real-time
- **Cloud Commands**: Supports affection adjustment commands from cloud
- **Threshold Triggers**: Unlocks hidden features when affection reaches specific values

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Communication and Monitoring
- **MQTT Protocol**: Implements reliable cloud communication based on Tuya cloud platform
- **Real-time Reporting**: Key status like affection is reported to cloud in real-time
- **Remote Control**: Supports remote monitoring and pet status adjustment through Tuya Smart App
- **Event-driven**: Responds immediately to cloud commands without polling

### üéôÔ∏è Smart Conversation Feature
- **Conditional Unlock**: Automatically enables voice interaction when affection reaches threshold
- **Large Language Model**: Integrates large language models for intelligent conversation experience
- **Multimodal Interaction**: Combines multiple interaction methods like gestures and voice

### üîß System Architecture Features
- **Multi-threaded Design**: Serial monitoring, cloud communication run in independent threads to ensure system responsiveness
- **Event-driven**: Uses callback mechanisms to handle cloud commands, avoiding ineffective polling and improving efficiency
- **Modular Structure**: Each functional module is independently designed for easy maintenance and expansion
- **Fault Tolerance**: Comprehensive exception handling mechanisms ensure stable system operation
